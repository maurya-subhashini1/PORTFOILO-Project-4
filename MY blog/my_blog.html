    <h2>How to become a great leader in business and in life</h2>
    <img class="hero-img" src="pasted image 0.png">
        <p>Here’s the thing about leadership that a lot of people either don’t understand or refuse to believe: everyone can be a leader. The leadership <br>definition is often misunderstood:Leadership isn’t something you’re either born with or without, but a powerful skill that can be developed<br> over time. In fact, you’
            ve probably taken on leadership roles in your life that you didn’t even realize at the
             time. So what is leadership, <br>really? And how can you sharpen those skills and 
             put them to work for you in your career  and your life?
             <h1>What is leadership?</h1>
             <p>Leadership is the ability to inspire a team to achieve a certain goal. It’s usually 
                 discussed in the context of business,<br> but leadership is also how you, as an individual, 
                  choose to lead your life. The true leadership definition <br>is to influence, inspire and 
                   help others become their best selves, building their skills and <br>achieving goals along the way. 
                    You don’t have to be a CEO, manager or even a team lead to be<br> a leader. Leadership is a set of skills </p>
                <p>– and a certain psychology – that anyone can master.</p>
                <p>Leadership is not a zero-sum equation. When one person harnesses their powers to lead, it strengthens the leadership opportunities of others, rather<br> than diminishing them.
                     That’s because the ultimate definition of leadership is empowering others to become effective leaders as well. That’s why <br>many iconic leaders have incredible mentors they
                      cite for their success. As one person begins to embrace their role <br>as a leader, they inevitably connect with others who have already mastered the art of leadership.</p>

                <p>In short, the importance of leadership lies in the ability to get things done. Leadership allows you to communi<br>
                cate a clear vision and then unite your team around that 
                vision. Companies with great leaders are creative, innovative<br> and agile. They also have positive
                company cultures with a sense of purpose and passion. <br>Ultimately, effective leadership improves your company’s bottom line, resulting in less turnover and a mindset of continuous </p>

                <h1 class="su-he">What is supportive leadership?</h1>
                <img src="suppo.jpeg">
                <p>Supportive leadership is a leadership style in which the leader supports their subordinates with tools and resources until they have the skills <br>
                to work autonomously. Supportive leaders do their best to ensure everyone on their team has the necessary skills, tools and resources <br>to complete 
                the task they've been assigned or find success in a long-term project.</p>
                <p>Often, the level of support varies from team member to team member depending on each individual employee's knowledge and needs. The objective of<br>
                     supportive leadership is team members who are capable of working autonomously, but who feel<br> comfortable seeking support when they need it.</p>
